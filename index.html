    <p>
        My family means everything to me. My parents have always been a source of 
        <strong>strength</strong> and <em>inspiration</em> in my life. 
        They taught me the importance of kindness and perseverance.

    <h2>Meet My Sibling</h2>

    <p>
        My sibling is my best friend and confidant. We share a lot of laughs and
        <strong>great memories</strong>. I wouldn't trade our bond for anything.
